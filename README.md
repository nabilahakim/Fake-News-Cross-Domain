# Fake-News-Cross-Domain

This repository contains code and experiments for cross-domain fake news detection using BERT and Domain Adaptation techniques. The research focuses on four different domains:

🏥 Health (A)

⚽ Sport (B)

🌍 Society (C)

🏛 Politics (D)

The primary goal is to improve fake news detection accuracy when training on one domain and testing on another using domain adaptation techniques.
